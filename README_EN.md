## Website
It is derived from [Canvas](https://themeforest.net/item/canvas-the-multipurpose-html5-template/9228123) theme. Because of commercial issues, we remove it from public repository.

## Admin Panel
It was developed with [Metronic](https://themeforest.net/item/metronic-responsive-admin-dashboard-template/4021469) theme when this project wasn't open source. Now we are changing admin theme to open source [AdminLTE](https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE), because [Metronic](https://themeforest.net/item/metronic-responsive-admin-dashboard-template/4021469) is a commercial template.
